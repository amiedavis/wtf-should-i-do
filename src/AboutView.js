        <p>
          Often when people are depressed, they find it difficult to work up the
          motivation to do activities that they used to find enjoyable or
          satisfying. Sometimes, people who are depressed can't even remember
          what they used to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project is to develop a website that offers up
          suggestions for activities people can try when they are struggling to
          think of what to do.
