Often when people are depressed, they find it difficult to work up the motivation to do activities that they used to find enjoyable or satisfyiing. Sometimes, people who are depressed can't even remember what they used to enjoy.

The purpose of this project is to develop a website that offers up suggestions for activities people can try when they are struggling to think of what to do.

Initially, this website will be very simple as I am using it as a tool for learning. However, ideally I would like to extend the idea to allow people to track activities that they enjoy, and furthermore include a rating system that allows people to keep track of their mood before and after undertaking a certain activity.
